### What is Hate Speech?
Hate speech is any toxic communication used to attack individuals or groups directly, especially based on the characteristics (but not limited to): physical deficiency, mental deficiency, moral deficiency, age, ethnicity, race, national origin, caste, religion, disability, serious disease, sex, gender, gender identity, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, and immigration status.

### Disclaimer
The dataset contains toxic data like using rude words, and these are not aligned with the definition of hate speech data mentioned above. 

### About Dataset and Why Do We Encrypt
The lack of Burmese data for AI research makes it difficult to progress in this field. Hate speech is also a big problem in Myanmar and needs attention. So, we're collecting hate speech posts and comments from Facebook. Students from the Data Science and Machine Learning Club at the University of Technology, Yatanarpon Cyber City are helping us gather this data manually. We now have a dataset with 14,787 comments and posts. Most of the data is collected in the years 2019 and 2020.
Because of ethical concerns, we encrypted the data, to decrypt the data, you will need to provide the information of the affiliation and academic works to get the key. Please contact hola@simbolomm.com.
But if you can decrypt it without needing our help, please feel free to use it. 
The hint is "find possible patterns of common characters like space".
